I completed my PhD in inorganic chemistry under [Jonas C. Peters](https://jcpgroup.caltech.edu) at Caltech, with a focus on molecular transition metal systems. As an undergraduate, I obtained dual B.Sc. degrees in chemistry and mathematics at the University of Chicago, where I studied under the late, great [Gregory L. Hillhouse](http://glh-group.uchicago.edu).

I am particularly interested in electronic structure aspects of transition metal chemistry, which I have historically pursued in the context of [small molecule activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiological_nitrogen_fixation). More recently, I have done battle with trying to understand the complex electronic structure of [iron--sulfur clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironâ€“sulfur_cluster), Nature's most ubiquitous metallocofactors.
