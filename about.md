## Biosketch
I completed my Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry under [Jonas C. Peters](https://jcpgroup.caltech.edu) at Caltech. My dissertation research focused on [nitrogen fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiological_nitrogen_fixation_using_homogeneous_catalysts) via transition metal complexes, with a particular focus on the chemistry of iron. As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, I obtained dual B.Sc. degrees in chemistry and mathematics, studying under the late [Gregory L. Hillhouse](http://glh-group.uchicago.edu).

Following the completion of my doctoral studies in 2018, I moved to Cambridge, MA to pursue postdoctoral training under [Daniel L. M. Suess](https://suessgroup.mit.edu), another trainee of Jonas's who had recently started his own laboratory at MIT. In Cambridge, we revitalized the program of [Dick Holm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Holm) to interrogate the physiochemical properties of [iron&ndash;sulfur clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron-sulfur_cluster), via novel synthetic approaches pioneered by Dan and his first cohort of students.

Delving into the complex electronic structures of metalloclusters forced my thinking beyond the molecular (few-&#8491;) scale. Indeed, many [interesting and unresolved questions](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00226a025) emerge from the study of magnetic clusters with respect to their nano- and mesoscale properties. Moreover, the [lability](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2210528120) of, in particular, iron&ndash;sulfur clusters demands us to understand not only *intra*molecular structure, but also interactions beyond the primary coordination sphere of the metal ions. With this in mind, in 2021 I joined the [Solar Energy Conversion Group](https://blogs.anl.gov/solar-energy/) at Argonne National Laboratory as a postdoctoral appointee under the supervision of [David M. Tiede](https://www.anl.gov/profile/david-m-tiede) and [Karen L. Mulfort](https://www.anl.gov/profile/karen-l-mulfort). 

At Argonne, I am interested in developing methodologies to study the local atomic structure of complex systems via total X-ray scattering. This work synthesizes atomistic simulation with experimental scattering studies, the latter conducted principally at the [Advanced Photon Source](https://www.aps.anl.gov) (and occasionally at [PETRA III](https://photon-science.desy.de/facilities/petra_iii/index_eng.html)). My initial interest in total scattering methodologies was due to the remarkable ability of this technique to elucidate solvation structure directly (<i>in situ</i>), and with exquisite resolution (sub-&#8491;). While this remains a focus of my research activity at Argonne, experience with synchrotron X-ray scattering (diffraction) has also widened my interests into materials science, in particular, characterization of the atomic structures of complex, hierarchical materials, such as [dye-sensitized metal-oxide thin films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye-sensitized_solar_cell), relevant for artifical photosynthesis applications. 

## Research interests
My research praxis is: Ask, precise, philisophico-scientific questions, develop the appropriate <i>ansatz</i> to interrogate those questions, and verify (or dispell) that <i>ansatz</i> through an attempted reconcilliation between experiment and theory. 

In modern industrial society, it is all-too-easy to subsume <i>Science</i> into <i>Technology</i>, which means: All Science serves an <i>end</i>, an end which <i>operationalizes</i> knowledge. This is a profoundly non-classical position, and, if philosophy of science teaches us anything, an unnecessary one. I prefer the historical category of <i>Natural Philosophy</i> to 'science', so understood. This means: <i>Phenomonology</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Philosophy</i>, on the other. A dialectical tension, whose resolution we suppose is called knowledge. 

As a pragmatism, one must take some things on faith (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>a priori</i>): things (<i>das Ding</i>) happen. The consequences of which <i>happening</i> are <i>measurable</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the objects of observation). This does not mean one measures the things in-themselves. That we can reason about these things, not measurable in-themselves, is the essence (<i>Wesen</i>) of philosophy. Science, in its essentially proper understanding, occurs at the nexus of these axiomatic priors. One <i>reasons</i> the causes (the things) that <i>produce</i> (through an act of faith) the (measurable) <i>phenomena</i>. Rendered in comtemporary dogma, we might say that the many-particle wavefunctions exist, only insofar as we can measure certain projections of their eigenstates&mdash;living in (the ineffable) infinite-dimensional Hilbert space&mdash;in so-called reality. 

[It remains that there may be im-measurable causes (<i>c.f.</i> [the Banach-Tarski decomposition of the sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banachâ€“Tarski_paradox)). Here we move, inexorably, towards mathematics and theology.] 

As such, the truth of Science lies precisely in that all true scientific theories are also, therefore, necessarly false. In chemistry, we have bonds, orbitals, atoms-in-molecules, <i>etc</i>. Each one of these concepts is endlessly argued about precisely because they are philosophical, and not natural. Nevertheless, such philosophical hallucinations evidently allow us to reconcile much, if not all, chemical phenomena. 

### Bioinorganic chemistry

Metals, particularly 3d metals, accomplish the most essential and most challenging chemical transformations that sustain 'life'. According to [H. B. Gray](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/366/2/ES40.2.1977.pdf), these are: (i) water oxidation; (ii) carbon fixation, (iii) nitrogen fixation; and, for (iv), one can pick one's favorite (proton reduction, for example). The study of the metal centers that catalyze these reactions lies at the heart of bioinorganic research. 

My practice in bioinorganic chemistry spans the formal ('model' chemistry) to the actual (metallocofactors in natural proteins)&mdash;although, admittedly, my perspective remains metal-centric. Model chemistry, so-called, is often a purely conceptual exercise, where the species under consideration only abstractly resembles actual metals in biology. Nevertheless, such abstraction does not blunt the power of model chemistries; on the contrary, with the benefit of modern chemical synthesis, one can ask and interrogate bioinorganic <i>questions</i> far more precisely than if one were restricted to the 'natural' metallocofactors, bioengineering notwithstanding. 

That said, there are certain, privileged classes of cofactors which can be prepared <i>de novo</i>, from their elements, via purely synthetic methods&mdash;most notably, perhaps, the iron&ndash;sulfur clusters. It is indeed at the level of (weak-field) metalloclusters where evolutionary biology still exceeds the synthetic chemist, and the future, here, lies, no doubt, in mimicking the <i>mesoscale</i> chemical engineering of the cell to template the synthesis of ever-more-complex clusters <i>in vitro</i>. The final dream of an 'inorganic total sythesis' is, surely, that of the [M-cluster of nitrogenase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FeMoco).  


### Spectroscopy
Spectroscopy, broadly interpreted, encompasses all light--matter interactions. For the chemist, this means different things at different frequencies.

At very low frequencies, $\mathcal{O}(1\text{ MHz})$, and in reasonable magnetic field strengths, one can probe the nuclear Zeeman interaction (NMR spectroscopy). At slightly higher frequencies, $\mathcal{O}(1\text{ GHz})$, but similar field strengths, one instead probes the electronic Zeeman interaction (EPR spectroscopy). At still higher frequencies, $\mathcal{O}(1\text{ THz})$, one probes the vibronic (photonic) modes typical of materials (IR spectroscopy). Higher, still, $\mathcal{O}(1\text{ PHz})\sim\mathcal{O}(1\text{ eV})$, transitions between electronic states (UV-vis spectroscopy). In the low-energy gamma regime, 14.412 keV, one finds the first nuclear excited state of <sup>57</sup>Fe. In a similar regime, $\mathcal{O}(1\text{ keV})$, one finds the 3d metal K-edges.

All of which is to say, there are a plethora of spectroscopies available, sensitive to distinct aspects of the generic chemical system. Typically, multiple distinct spectroscopic modalities are necessary to even approach what could be called an understanding of any such system. Of course, the boundaries above are not strict, and many interesting phenomena occur when there is significant spectral overlap between distinct modalities of light--matter interaction.

#### X-ray Scattering
At very high photon energies, in the X-ray regime, and especially in the so-called 'hard' X-ray regime (say, $\mathcal{O}[1\text{ MeV}]$), the light--matter interaction is intrinsically weak. So weak, indeed, that the probability that photons impinging on a nucleus simply scatter, elastically, off of the core electron density, becomes significant. If a coherent source of X-rays is used to illuminate a collection of atoms, then the elastic scattering of these coherent photons records, through their mutual interference, two-body information pertaining to the collection of atoms. 

Hence, we have 'diffraction', as such, from the point-like Bragg scattering of (ideally) infinite lattices to the diffuse halos of 'amorphous' systems. Some, no doubt, would object to the classification of X-ray scattering as a category of spectroscopy; but, if photons admit a continuous spectrum, why not spectroscopy, if one understands it as light--matter interaction?
