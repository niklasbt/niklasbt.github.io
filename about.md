I completed my Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry under [Jonas C. Peters](https://jcpgroup.caltech.edu) at Caltech, with a focus on molecular transition metal systems. As an undergraduate, I obtained dual B.Sc. degrees in chemistry and mathematics at the University of Chicago, where I studied under the late, great [Gregory L. Hillhouse](http://glh-group.uchicago.edu).

I am particularly interested in electronic structure aspects of transition metal chemistry, which I have previously pursued in the context of [small molecule activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiological_nitrogen_fixation). More recently, I have become interested in the complex electronic structures of molecular clusters, specifically those of the [iron--sulfur clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironâ€“sulfur_cluster), Nature's most ubiquitous metallocofactors.

There is a rich electronic landscape to explore as one hierarchically ascends from mononuclear $\rightarrow$ polynuclear $\rightarrow$ nanoscale transition metal materials, with novel phenomena emerging at each increase in length scale.

More on these topics can be found in my [published work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4OvsMZoAAAAJ&hl=en).
