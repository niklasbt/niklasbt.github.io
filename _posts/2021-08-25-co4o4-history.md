In connection with work I will be conducting at Argonne National Laboratory, I want to collect a timeline on the development of cobalt oxo cubane ([Co<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]) clusters in the context of OER:

$$
  \begin{equation}
  2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{O}_2 + 4 \text{H}^+ + 4 \text{e}^-
  \end{equation}
$$

Timeline can be found [here](/assets/co4o4-history/timeline/timeline.html).[^1]
