In connection with work I will be conducting at Argonne National Laboratory, I want to collect a timeline[^1] on the development of cobalt oxo cubane ([Co<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]) clusters in the context of OER:

$$
  \begin{equation}
  2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{O}_2 + 4 \text{H}^+ + 4 \text{e}^-
  \end{equation}
$$

I also provide a timeline for the discovery and study of the so-called [Co-OEC catalyst of Nocera](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5892/1072), which to a large extent has motivated the work done in the molecular system.
