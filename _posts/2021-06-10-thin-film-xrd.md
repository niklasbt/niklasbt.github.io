## Introductory remarks

Over the past year-ish at ANL, I have been studying the problem of X-ray diffraction (XRD) from amorphous systems, which has been a bit of an eye-opener to the more general domain of hard X-ray sciences enabled at the Advanced Photon Source. Coming from a background in molecular inorganic chemistry, my understanding of XRD has largely been developed in the context of single-crystal XRD (SCXRD), which is, arguably, the most powerful technique available to the chemist for studying molecular materials at the atomic scale.

However, there is one important caveat, namely, that you need a crystal. The (quasi-)infinite periodic lattice provided by a crystalline setting is what gives rise to sharp reflections in reciprocal space, from which precise 3-dimensional atomic structure can be deduced. However, what if you are interested in the structure of a material in a non-crystalline setting (e.g., the structure of a molecule in dilute solution)?

Of course, there is nothing preventing one from performing an XRD experiment on such samples, but the question is, can you extract structural information in the absence of Bragg reflections? The answer is: [of course](https://www.elsevier.com/books/underneath-the-bragg-peaks/egami/978-0-08-097133-9)! And the problem of extracting structural information from the so-called *diffuse* scattering (to distinguish it from the Bragg scattering) has been studied [at least as long as SCXRD](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-013-1889-2).

## Diffraction from thin films

At ANL, we have been interested in try to use XRD to study the atomic structures of thin (amorphous) films (such as [Nocera's CoPi catalyst](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5892/1072)). While our group has studied the structure of this catalyst *ex situ*, we would like to extend the measurement capability to an *in operando* setting. More generally, with the advent of nano-technology and "molecular engineering", it is of interest to develop techniques to extract quantitative structural information of ultrathin films at the atomic scale, especially in contexts where the material is too disorded to be studied by cutting-edge imaging techniques.

What do I mean by "ultrathin"? Well, the ultimate goal would be something like being able to characterize the atomic structure of a molecular monolayer.

Obviously, there are significant challenges associated with this. We are also not alone in try to extend the domain of XRD to this ultrathin context. Here, I want to collect as close to a comprehensive publication list relevant to this problem.

### Publication list

1. *Demonstration of thin film pair distribution function analysis (tfPDF) for the study of local structure in amorphous and crystalline thin films* [Billinge **2015**](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252515012221)
  * Billinge argues that the grazing incidence (GI) geometry complicates analysis too much.
  * This comment is particularly interesting:
    >All films studied were deposited on amorphous substrates, as this allows for simple subtraction of the substrate scattering signal without the need to mask intense, orientation-dependent scattering signals from single-crystal substrates, e.g. silicon wafers. No angular-dependent corrections are needed, as would be the case for grazing-incidence measurements. By use of PDFgetX3, where ad hoc corrections for fluorescence, Compton scattering and any other non structural effects are carried out, PDFs can be obtained quickly in a robust manner. The thin films that have been studied here are all ca. 360â€…nm thick, but PDFs from even thinner films may also be obtained, as long as background subtraction of the substrate signal is performed.

2. *Pair distribution functions of amorphous organic thin films from synchrotron X-ray scattering in transmission mode* [Yu & Zhang **2017**](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252517009344)
3. *Local atomic structure of thin and ultrathin films via rapid high-energy X-ray total scattering at grazing incidence* [Dippel **2019**](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252519000514)
4. *Time-resolved grazing-incidence pair distribution functions during deposition by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering* [Iversen **2019**](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252519001192)
